QCINV
=====

A python-based C^{-1} filtering code,
including the multigrid approach of 
Smith, Dore, and Zahn (arxiv:0705.3980).

Requirements:
 * numpy
 * pyfits
 * healpy

Is known to work with:
 * python 2.6.1
 * numpy 1.5.0
 * pyfits 2.4.0
 * healpy 0.10.2

Older versions probably work as well.

It's not explicitly parallel, but the
healpy transforms which dominate the
computational cost can use OpenMP.

To install:

python setup.py install

(or add the qcinv directory to your $PYTHONPATH)

To test:

There are a few scripts in the test/ directory,
to sanity check pieces of the library. Probably
want to run test_cd_solve.py and test_cg_solve.py
to make sure that the conjugate solvers work, as
well as some of the numpy linear algebra.

The construction of a fast multigrid chain is
something of an art-- there are a few sample
WMAP chains in the test/test_multigrid directory.

To give them a try, first download the
necessary WMAP data using the get script

cd test/test_multigrid/inputs/wmap
./get 

Then generate a simple WMAP V-band simulation
with a sky mask and inhomogeneous noise using

cd test/test_multigrid
scripts/run_sim_WMAP_inhomog.py

In the test/test_multigrid/inputs directory
there are several sample chains, which can be
run using the run_chain.py script.

They contain:
 chain 1 - simple diagonal preconditioner (no multigrid).
 chain 2 - three stage multigrid, with diagonal preconditioner at each stage.
 chain 3 - four stage multigrid, with diagonal preconditioner at each stage.
 chain 4 - three stage multigrid, with dense preconditioner up to l=64.
 chain 5 - two stage multigrid, with dense preconditioner up to l=64.

Chains 4 and 5 are the fastest, and converge to \epsilon=10^{-6} 
in about 5 minutes on a single core of my 2.6GHz MacBook Pro. 
To run, just call e.g. 

scripts/run_sim_WMAP_inhomog.py inputs/par_sim_WMAP_inhomog_chain_04.py
scripts/run_chain.py inputs/par_sim_WMAP_inhomog_chain_04.py

The dense preconditioners take a minute or two to construct,
but are cached by the multigrid chain so this isn't much overhead
if you're going to filter a bunch of simulations.
